            <h3>Methodology</h3>

            <p>

            <p>Congressional net worth estimates are based on 2023 financial disclosure reports downloaded from the <a
                    href="https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/FinancialDisclosure">House of Representatives</a>. Asset
                and liability ranges were reviewed and aggregated to calculate an average net worth for each
                representative.
            </p>

            <p>I followed the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances/methodology">Open Secrets</a>
                methodology for figuring net worth of congressional representatives.

            <blockquote>Net worth was calculated by summing the filer's assets and then subtracting any listed
                liabilities.
                Filers report the amount of each of their assets, transactions and liabilities as falling within one of
                several ranges. The minimum possible values for each asset were added together as were the maximum
                possible
                values. Likewise, minimum and maximum liability amounts were summed. The maximum debt figure was then
                subtracted from the minimum asset figure and the minimum debt figure was subtracted from the maximum
                asset
                figure. The resulting range represents the extremes of how much a filer could be worth, and his or her
                actual net worth should fall somewhere within that range.</blockquote>
            </p>

            <p>
                An index score was calculated in an attempt to normalize and compare the net worth of congressional
                representatives relative to their constiuency. It is challenging to find data on the average or median
                networth of folks living in a congressional district. As a proxy I used median annual income of a
                congressional district. District-level median household income data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau.

                Thus the calculation for the index is:

            <blockquote><em>(Congressional Net Worth − Constituent Median Income) ÷ Constituent Median Income</em>
            </blockquote>

            </p>

            <p>
                While it would be best to use the net worth of the constituency, such data is difficult to find. This
                was conducted as an exploratory exercise to see if any large discrepancies exist that would prompt
                future
                investigation.
            </p>

            <h3>Why this Matters</h3>

            <p>The main question we are seeking to answer is: <b>Can a representative that is 5 times, 10 times, or over
                    100 times more wealthy than their constituency understand the needs of their district?</b>

            <p>Which yields additional questions such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>How does their wealth change their understanding of and relationship to work?</li>
                <li>To time and family?</li>
                <li>To risk, debt, and healthcare?</li>
                <li>Once elected, does their substantial wealth work to keep them in power?</li>
                <li>How much has their wealth changed since being elected?</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>The intent of this project is not to shame individuals. It's purpose is to provoke thought and encourage
                deeper questions about how wealth, representation, and policy intersect. Hopefully it inspires you to
                consider such questions the next time you head to the ballot box.</p>
