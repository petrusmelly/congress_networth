## Purpose

This project was inspired by the question:

**Can someone who is 10, 50, or 200 times wealthier than their average constituent truly understand the needs of the people they represent?**

Using public financial disclosures and Census income data, it creates a **Wealth Disparity Index** for each congressional district:

**(Net Worth âˆ’ Median Income) Ã· Median Income**

The results are shown as a color-coded choropleth map of Illinois districts, allowing users to explore how the wealth of their representative matches up with their median annual income.
